        Welcome to the Online <i>Fortress of Solitude</i>, a virtual place for avid readers and learners to explore in their own
        happy spheres of comfort and silence! Now, this may not be the physical haven of peace where you can bring all your amazing
        books and read with joy and passion, but never fear! We offer a lot of quality of life features on this site that will make
        your experience - both in the library and on this website - much, much better!

        <br><br>

        A frustrating thing about any library is arguably the <i>waiting</i>. You have to wait in line to borrow a book, to confirm
        the borrowal. You have to wait in line to ask some person if some book is available. It takes time, maybe more than you can
        possibly afford, to just down and read.

        <br><br>

        In order to fix this, we this portal where we provide you with the ability to do plenty of things from the comfort of wherever 
        you are, things that you can complete here with ease so that when you do come to the library, all you have to do is sit down 
        and read, because, ultimately, that's all a library is for.

        In order to access the various features that we have provided, you will have to register first. Once registered, you will be able to
        login and then do nearly <i>everything</i>: search, borrow, suggest - you name it. You'll see everything that you can do after you login.
